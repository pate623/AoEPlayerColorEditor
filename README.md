# AoE:DE Player Color Editor
Tool to edit Age of Empires Definitive Edition player colors.

Some of the player colors in Age of Empires(https://store.steampowered.com/app/1017900) are too similar causing confusion. This tool fixes that problem by allowing you to edit the colors to your liking, there is also premade color presets.

The color palettes folder is easy to locate if the game is installed in the Steam default folder, clicking locate color palettes folder should open the correct folder right away.

This program is made for windows. No installation needed just run the “Player Color Editor.exe” from the released version.

Or download the source code and build this software using Microsoft Visual Studio. <br>If you encounter any compilation errors make sure you have Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package installed.
